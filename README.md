Quidditch World Cup Backend can be coupled with Quidditch World Cup Frontend for a viewing of a psuedo sports website that will update games, track data and declare a winner of the 431st Quidditch World Cup in the year 2030.  

To run a new season, run the following commands first: 

```rails db:create```<br />
```rails db:migrate```<br />
```rails db:seed``` <br />
```rails server``` <br />

Upon season close you may run: 

```rails db:drop```<br />

Then rerun the new season commands to start a new season.
